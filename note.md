why grow your own houseplants from seed?

Starting a houseplant from seed is the best way to ensure they'll grow up to be strong and healthy. As they grow they will become acclimated to the temperature, watering schedule, and light levels of your home. But besides that, starting a plant from seed is rewarding as all heck! You'll get to watch your small, fragile little friend grow so tall you can give them a hug....or at least a high-five.
